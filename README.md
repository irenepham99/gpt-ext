# GPT Extension

Have a better experience on ChatGPT with response length control and scroll to response top!
<br>
<br>

## To try the extension: 

Hold on just a tad - the extension is still under review in the chrome extension store. 
<br>
<br>

## To install the extension locally and run it in developer mode: 

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run build`. This should create a `dist` folder with the extension files.
4. Open Chrome (or any Chromium based browser) and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
5. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner.
6. Click "Load unpacked."
7. Select the `dist` folder.
8. Test the extension.
